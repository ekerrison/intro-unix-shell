title: "Working With Files and Directories"
teaching: 30
exercises: 20
questions:
- "How can I create, copy, and delete files and directories?"
- "How can I edit files?"
objectives:
- "Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram."
- "Create files in that hierarchy using an editor or by copying and renaming existing files."
- "Delete, copy and move specified files and/or directories."
keypoints:
- "`cp [old] [new]` copies a file."
- "`mkdir [path]` creates a new directory."
- "`mv [old] [new]` moves (renames) a file or directory."
- "`rm [path]` removes (deletes) a file."
- "`*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`."
- "`?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`."
- "The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone."
- "Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file."
- "Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano."

## Creating directories
We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them in the first place?

### Step one: see where we are and what we already have
Let's go back to our `shell-lesson-data` directory on the Desktop
and use `ls -F` to see what it contains:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  writing/
~~~
{: .output}

### Create a directory

Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis`
(which has no output):

~~~
$ mkdir thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

As you might guess from its name,
`mkdir` means 'make directory'.
Since `thesis` is a relative path
(i.e., does not have a leading slash, like `/what/ever/thesis`),
the new directory is created in the current working directory:

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg
solar.pdf  thesis/  writing/
~~~
{: .output}

Since we've just created the `thesis` directory, there's nothing in it yet:

~~~
$ ls -F thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Note that `mkdir` is not limited to creating single directories one at a time.
The `-p` option allows `mkdir` to create a directory with nested subdirectories
in a single operation:

~~~
$ mkdir -p project/data project/results
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Two ways of doing the same thing
> Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer.
> If you open the current directory using your operating system's graphical file explorer,
> the `thesis` directory will appear there too.
> While the shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files,
> the files and directories themselves are the same.
{: .callout}

> ## Good names for files and directories
>
> Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful
> when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful

>
> 1. Don't use spaces.

>    To test this out, try typing `mkdir north pacific gyre`and see what directory (or directories!)
>    are made when you check with `ls -F`.
>

>
>    Commands treat names starting with `-` as options.

>
> If you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces
> or other special characters, you should surround the name in quotes (`""`).
{: .callout}

### Create a text file
Let's change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`,
then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:

~~~
$ cd thesis
$ nano draft.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Which Editor?
>
> When we say, '`nano` is a text editor' we really do mean 'text': it can
> only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other
> human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the
> least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may
> not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do
> after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS),
> many programmers use [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or
> [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (both of which require more time to learn),
> or a graphical editor such as
> [Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/). On Windows, you may wish to
> use [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).  Windows also has a built-in
> editor called `notepad` that can be run from the command line in the same
> way as `nano` for the purposes of this lesson.
>
> No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches
> for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably)
> use your current working directory as its default location. If you use
> your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or
> documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to
> another directory the first time you 'Save As...'
{: .callout}

Let's type in a few lines of text.
Once we're happy with our text, we can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>
(press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while
holding it down, press the <kbd>O</kbd> key) to write our data to disk
(we'll be asked what file we want to save this to:
press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the suggested default of `draft.txt`).

<div style="width:80%; margin: auto;"><img alt="screenshot of nano text editor in action"
src="../fig/nano-screenshot.png"></div>

Once our file is saved, we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to quit the editor and
return to the shell.

`nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
draft.txt
~~~
{: .output}

{: .callout}

## Moving files and directories
Returning to the `shell-lesson-data` directory,

```
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/
```
{: .language-bash}

In our `thesis` directory we have a file `draft.txt`
which isn't a particularly informative name,
so let's change the file's name using `mv`,
which is short for 'move':

~~~
$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The first argument tells `mv` what we're 'moving',
while the second is where it's to go.
In this case,
we're moving `thesis/draft.txt` to `thesis/quotes.txt`,
which has the same effect as renaming the file.
Sure enough,
`ls` shows us that `thesis` now contains one file called `quotes.txt`:

~~~
$ ls thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
quotes.txt
~~~
{: .output}

One must be careful when specifying the target file name, since `mv` will
silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could
lead to data loss. An additional option, `mv -i` (or `mv --interactive`),
can be used to make `mv` ask you for confirmation before overwriting.

Note that `mv` also works on directories.

Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory.
We use `mv` once again,
but this time we'll use just the name of a directory as the second argument
to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename
but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called 'move'.)
In this case,
the directory name we use is the special directory name`.` that we mentioned earlier.

~~~
$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.
`ls` now shows us that `thesis` is empty:

~~~
$ ls thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
$
~~~
{: .output}

Alternatively, we can confirm the file `quotes.txt` is no longer present in the `thesis` directory
by explicitly trying to list it:

~~~
$ ls thesis/quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

```
ls: cannot access 'thesis/quotes.txt': No such file or directory
```
{: .output}

`ls` with a filename or directory as an argument only lists the requested file or directory.
If the file given as the argument doesn't exist, the shell returns an error as we saw above.
We can use this to see that `quotes.txt` is now present in our current directory:

~~~
$ ls quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
quotes.txt
~~~
{: .output}

## Copying files and directories

The `cp` command works very much like `mv`,
except it copies a file instead of moving it.
We can check that it did the right thing using `ls`
with two paths as arguments --- like most Unix commands,
`ls` can be given multiple paths at once:

~~~
$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .output}

We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the
[recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) option `-r`,
e.g. to back up a directory:

```
$ cp -r thesis thesis_backup
```
{: .language-bash}

We can check the result by listing the contents of both the `thesis` and `thesis_backup` directory:

```
$ ls thesis thesis_backup
```
{: .language-bash}

```
thesis:
quotations.txt

thesis_backup:
quotations.txt
```
{: .output}

## Removing files and directories

Returning to the `shell-lesson-data` directory,
let's tidy up this directory by removing the `quotes.txt` file we created.
The Unix command we'll use for this is `rm` (short for 'remove'):

~~~
$ rm quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

We can confirm the file has gone using `ls`:

~~~
$ ls quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

```
ls: cannot access 'quotes.txt': No such file or directory
```
{: .output}

{: .challenge}


If we try to remove the `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`,
we get an error message:

~~~
$ rm thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
rm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory
~~~
{: .error}

This happens because `rm` by default only works on files, not directories.

`rm` can remove a directory *and all its contents* if we use the
recursive option `-r`, and it will do so *without any confirmation prompts*:

~~~
$ rm -r thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Given that there is no way to retrieve files deleted using the shell,
`rm -r` *should be used with great caution*
(you might consider adding the interactive option `rm -r -i`).

## Operations with multiple files and directories

Oftentimes one needs to copy or move several files at once.
This can be done by providing a list of individual filenames,
or specifying a naming pattern using wildcards.

### Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once

> ## Wildcards
>
> `*` is a **wildcard**, which matches zero or more  characters.
> Let's consider the `shell-lesson-data/molecules` directory:
> `*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every
> file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches
> `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only
> matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.
>
> `?` is also a wildcard, but it matches exactly one character.
> So `?ethane.pdb` would match `methane.pdb` whereas
> `*ethane.pdb` matches both `ethane.pdb`, and `methane.pdb`.
>
> Wildcards can be used in combination with each other
> e.g. `???ane.pdb` matches three characters followed by `ane.pdb`,
> giving `cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb`.
>
> When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a
> list of matching filenames *before* running the command that was
> asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match
> any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command
> as it is.

>
> 1. `ls *t*ane.pdb`
> 2. `ls *t?ne.*`
> 3. `ls *t??ne.pdb`
> 4. `ls ethane.*`
>
> > ## Solution
>>  The solution is `3.`
>>
>> `1.` shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (`*`)
>> followed by the letter `t`,
>> then zero or more characters (`*`) followed by `ane.pdb`.
>> This gives `ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb`.
>>
>> `2.` shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (`*`) followed by
>> the letter `t`,
>> then a single character (`?`), then `ne.` followed by zero or more characters (`*`).
>> This will give us `octane.pdb` and `pentane.pdb` but doesn't match anything
>> which ends in `thane.pdb`.
>>
>> `3.` fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (`??`) between `t` and `ne`.
>> This is the solution.
>>
>> `4.` only shows files starting with `ethane.`.
